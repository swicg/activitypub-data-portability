# Activitypub Data Portability

Repository for the  ActivityPub Data Portability Task Force of the social web community group at W3C.

We maintain:

* A descriptive report covering the Data Portability problem space, which so far lists all the different data surfaces that end-users might want to include in scope of portability use-cases. The current editor's draft of this report is [here](https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-data-portability/)
* A draft of a Server-to-Server transfer protocol called LOLA. The current editor's draft of this report is [here](https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-data-portability/)

Input documents from the developer community that we've discussed on calls and may be taken on as work items in the future (See the CG's [Staging Process](https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/blob/main/stage-process.md)):
