      <p>This document describes data portability in ActivityPub.
        It lists what data exists for an actor. It then describes two modes of data
        portability for an actor: using a domain, and Mastodon-style <code>Move</code>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Data portability is the ability of a user to move their data from one
        system to another system. This includes moving between ActivityPub
        implementations, moving to different installations of the same
        software, or changing domains.

      <h2>Data elements</h2>
      <p>
        This is a list of data objects that are part of an actor's data.

      <h2>Domain portability</h2>
      <p>
        This is a process for moving an actor from one ActivityPub server to another.
        It requires the user to run a server on a domain they control.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The user backs up all data for the account at username@old.example.</li>
                <li>The user shuts down the old implementation running at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user installs the new implementation at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user restores all data to the account at username@old.example.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>All user data is available.</li>
                <li>All links from others' servers are still valid.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>No standard format for backup files exists; see https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/370.</li>
                <li>The user has to register and maintain their own domain name.</li>
                <li>The user has to run their own server, or use a hosting service that allows mapping their own domain name.</li>
                <li>Different implementations may use different URI patterns for activities or content.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Move action</h2>
        <p>
            Mastodon and compatible server software use a <code>Move</code> activity
            to move an actor from one server to another.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The user will typically execute these steps using a Web interface or an API client, rather than executing them directly.</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The user creates a new actor at username@new.example</li>
                    <li>The user marks the new actor as accepting a move with the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user marks the old actor as having moved with the <code>movedTo</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user sends a <code>Move</code> activity from the old actor to all followers.

                    </li>
                    <li>Each follower checks the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property of the new account and <code>movedTo</code> property of the old account.</li>
                    <li>Each follower sends a <code>Follow</code> activity to the new account.</li>
                    <li>Each follower sends an <code>Undo Follow</code> activity to the old account.</li>
                    <li>The old account's profile URI redirects to the new account's profile URI.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The user exports the old account's <code>following</code> list as a CSV file.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The user imports the CSV file into the new account.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The new account sends a <code>Follow</code> activity to each account in the imported CSV file.</li>

                    <li>Content like images, videos, text, audio that are created in the old account is not moved to the new account.
                        If the old server goes down, all that content is lost.</li>
                    <li>Other user data listed above, like replies, likes, blocks are also not ported.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Added the limitation that a lot of data is not ported in the <code>Move</code> activity technique.</li>
        <li>Note that users will typically use software to make changes to their actor record or send activities.</li>
