      <p>This document describes data portability in ActivityPub.
        It lists what data exists for an actor. It then describes two modes of data
        portability for an actor: using a domain, and Mastodon-style <code>Move</code>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Data portability is the ability of a user to move their data from one
        system to another system. This includes moving between ActivityPub
        implementations, moving to different installations of the same
        software, or changing domains.
      </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p>
        The following terms are used to describe concepts in this report.
      </p>

      <dl class="termlist">
        <dt><dfn data-lt="instance|instances">instance</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An informal name for an ActivityPub <a>server</a>, specifically,
          a particular instance of a given ActivityPub server implementation.
          In current implementations, instances are typically bound to a given
          URL / Web domain, which has implications for identity portability and
          data portability in general.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn data-lt="server|servers">server</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An implementation of an <strong>ActivityPub conformant Server</strong>,
          as defined in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#specification-profiles">ActivityPub
            Specification Profiles</a>. <em>See also:</em> <a>instance</a>.

      <h2>Domain portability</h2>
      <p>
        This is a process for moving an actor from one ActivityPub server to another.
        It requires the user to run a server on a domain they control.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The user backs up all data for the account at username@old.example.</li>
                <li>The user shuts down the old implementation running at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user installs the new implementation at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user restores all data to the account at username@old.example.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>All user data is available.</li>
                <li>All links from others' servers are still valid.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>No standard format for backup files exists; see https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/370.</li>
                <li>The user has to register and maintain their own domain name.</li>
                <li>The user has to run their own server, or use a hosting service that allows mapping their own domain name.</li>
                <li>Different implementations may use different URI patterns for activities or content.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Move action</h2>
        <p>
            Mastodon and compatible server software use a <code>Move</code> activity
            to move an actor from one server to another.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The user will typically execute these steps using a Web interface or an API client, rather than executing them directly.</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The user creates a new actor at username@new.example</li>
                    <li>The user marks the new actor as accepting a move with the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user marks the old actor as having moved with the <code>movedTo</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user sends a <code>Move</code> activity from the old actor to all followers.

                    <li>The old account's profile URI redirects to the new account's profile URI.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The user exports the old account's <code>following</code> list as a CSV file.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The user imports the CSV file into the new account.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) The new account sends a <code>Follow</code> activity to each account in the imported CSV file.</li>
