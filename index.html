      <p>This document describes data portability in ActivityPub.
        It lists what data exists for an actor. It then describes two modes of data
        portability for an actor: using a domain, and Mastodon-style <code>Move</code>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Data portability is the ability of a user to move their data from one
        system to another system. This includes moving between ActivityPub
        implementations, moving to different installations of the same
        software, or changing domains.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Objects and Activities</h3>

        <p>
          The basic unit of data for the ActivityPub protocol is an
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#obj">ActivityPub Object</a>,
          a structured (JSON) document with a set of required and optional
          properties. The core set of properties are defined in the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-object">ActivityStreams 2</a>
          data model specification, and ActivityPub adds a couple of additional
          requirements (namely, that all objects must have a <code>type</code>
          property, as well as a globally unique <code>id</code> that serves as
          that object's location).
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of data migration and portability, objects by themselves
          are very simple: because an object's <code>id</code> serves as its
          location (as specified in
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/#obj-id">ActivityPub Section 3.1</a>),
          the process of moving an object is as simple transporting it (by any
          appropriate protocol), and updating its <code>id</code> property to
          its new location.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the context of ActivityPub use cases, objects are almost
          never encountered by themselves, in isolation. Because ActivityPub
          is a protocol intended for building distributed social systems, it has
          two important design aspects: one, authorship and provenance are
          important, and two, objects are not intended to be created or mutated
          directly, but are instead wrapped in lifecycle Activities (such as
          <code>Create</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>Delete</code>, and
          others). In distributed system design, this is known as the Event
          Sourcing pattern, where the state of each object is not stored directly,
          but is instead constructed from a series of actions taken on the object.
          The fact that these are social systems brings additional challenges:
          the series of Actions are always attributed to (performed by) a
          particular <a>Actor</a>. Also, these Actions typically have an intended
          audience, which means that for any state change the object undergoes,
          there may exist any number of stakeholders who must be informed about
          those changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taken together, the design aspects of the ActivityPub protocol present
          non-trivial challenges, when it comes to data migration and portability.
          Objects are never encountered by themselves, in isolation. Instead, they
          exist only as an append-only series of Actions, each performed by an
          Actor, within a social context (each action typically has intended
          audiences, as well as other observers and stakeholders).
          And because of that, moving an object means not only updating its
          <code>id</code> to a new location, but it also means preserving its
          chain of actions, authorship, and full social context.
        </p>

        <h3>ActivityPub Actor Identity</h3>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub 1.0 Specification</a>
          was intentionally silent on the subject of <a>actor</a> identity,
          authentication and authorization, leaving those up to <a>server</a>
          implementers. Multiple implementations arose that modeled <a>actors</a>
          as traditional user accounts, which controlled various types of data,
          such as contents (posts, notes, comments, images, likes, etc), related
          data such as bookmarks, social graphs (lists of followers and following
          users), actor metadata, moderation decisions (block lists, mutes), and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          - data migration basically always means migration of a given Actor,
            and all of the data that belongs to it
          - complex mapping between Actor and users -- some Actors are controlled
            by multiple users, and some users can have many Actors.
          - discuss the 3 aspects of an Actor's identity: actor id (url),
            actor webfinger identity, cryptographic material.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Instance Oriented Architecture</h3>

        <p>
          - for various historical reasons, ActivityPub implementations have
            centered around the concept of Instances.
          - this is not inherent in the ActivityPub protocol, but is an arbitrary
            set of design choices, a historical artifact
          - instances bundle together several key functions (which could be
            separated, in theory):
            1. Identity
            2. Storage
            3. Inbox/Outbox delivery, event subscriptions
            4. Moderation
            5. Community discovery
          - the fact that these functions are bundled together makes portability
            and migration even more challenging.

        <h3>Data Portability, Migration, and Export</h3>

        <p>
          Data Portability, Migration, and Export / Backup, are separate but
          closely related concepts.
        </p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Data Export / Backup (Data Model)</h4>

          <p>
            The ability to export all of the data for a given
            <a>actor</a> is helpful as an additional mechanism of data recovery,
            since it makes user-controlled backups possible (as opposed to server
            administrator controlled backups of backend databases, etc). And
            although the ability to export data, by itself, does not guarantee
            data portability (since many current implementations provide only
            export but not import functionality), having a well-defined and
            documented export format at least makes future import functionality
            possible.

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Data Migration (Protocol)</h4>

          <p>
            Data Migration is the process of moving or copying

      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p>
        The following terms are used to describe concepts in this report.
      </p>

      <dl class="termlist">

        <dt><dfn data-lt="actor|actors">actor</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A conforming

        <dd>An informal name for an ActivityPub <a>server</a>, specifically,
          a particular instance of a given ActivityPub server implementation.
          In current implementations, instances are typically bound to a given

          data portability in general.

      <h2>Domain portability</h2>
      <p>
        This is a process for moving an actor from one ActivityPub server to another.
        It requires the user to run a server on a domain they control.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The user backs up all data for the account at username@old.example.</li>
                <li>The user shuts down the old implementation running at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user installs the new implementation at old.example.</li>
                <li>The user restores all data to the account at username@old.example.</li>

        <h2>Move action</h2>
        <p>
            Mastodon and compatible server software use a <code>Move</code> activity
            to move an actor from one server to another.

        <section>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The user will typically execute these steps using a Web interface or an API client, rather than executing them directly.</p>

                    <li>The user creates a new actor at username@new.example</li>
                    <li>The user marks the new actor as accepting a move with the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user marks the old actor as having moved with the <code>movedTo</code> property.</li>
                    <li>The user sends a <code>Move</code> activity from the old actor to all followers.
